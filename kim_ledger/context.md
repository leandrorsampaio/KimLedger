Hello! We are resuming work on an existing Flutter project called KimLedger. I have lost the previous context, so this prompt will bring you up to speed on the project's status.

1. Project Goal & Technology
The objective is to build a secure, cross-platform desktop application for personal finance tracking using Flutter and Dart. The app uses an encrypted SQLite database (sqflite_sqlcipher) for storage and the Provider package for state management.

2. Current Project Status
We have already completed the initial setup and the entire data layer. The following files and directories have been created and contain functional code:

Project Structure:

A Flutter project named kim_ledger has been created.

Inside the lib folder, we have the following directories: models, screens, services, and widgets.

Data Models (lib/models/):

category.dart: Defines the Category class with id and name fields.

expense.dart: Defines the Expense class with fields like id, description, value, date, and categoryId.

Database Service (lib/services/database_service.dart):

A DatabaseService class has been created. It's a singleton that manages the encrypted SQLite database connection.

It includes methods to initialize the database (_initDB), create tables (_createDB), and perform all data operations (e.g., addCategory, getExpenses).

State Management (lib/services/data_provider.dart):

A DataProvider class using ChangeNotifier has been created.

It acts as the bridge between the UI and the DatabaseService. It has a fetchData() method to load all expenses and categories and notify the UI of any changes.

Main UI (lib/screens/ and lib/main.dart):

home_screen.dart: A basic HomeScreen widget has been built. It uses Provider.of<DataProvider>(context) to fetch and display a list of expenses from the DataProvider.

main.dart: The main application entry point has been updated to use ChangeNotifierProvider, making the DataProvider available throughout the entire app and setting HomeScreen as the initial screen.

3. Summary
In short, the application is currently capable of initializing an encrypted database, reading data from it, managing that data via a provider, and displaying it in a simple list on the home screen.

We are now ready to continue development from this point.
