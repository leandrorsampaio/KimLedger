## Architecture Overview

This is a Flutter expense tracking application called "KimLedger" with the following structure:

### Core Architecture
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for managing app state
- **Database**: SQLite with encryption (sqflite_sqlcipher) for secure data storage
- **UI Framework**: Flutter Material Design

### Key Components

#### Database Layer (`lib/services/database_service.dart`)
- **Singleton pattern** for database access across the app
- **Encrypted SQLite database** with sqflite_sqlcipher for secure data storage
- **Database schema**: Two main tables with foreign key relationship
  - `categories`: id, name
  - `expenses`: id, description, value, user, date, category_id
- **CRUD operations**: Complete methods for adding/retrieving categories and expenses
- **Development features**: Includes dummy data generation and database reset functionality
- **SECURITY NOTE**: Database password is currently hardcoded as 'your-super-secret-password' - this should be changed in production

#### Data Models (`lib/models/`)
- **`Category`** (`category.dart`): Represents expense categories with id and name fields
- **`Expense`** (`expense.dart`): Represents financial transactions with:
  - Core fields: id, description, value, date, categoryId
  - Additional fields: user, categoryName (for JOIN results)
  - Database serialization methods (toMap/fromMap)

#### State Management (`lib/services/data_provider.dart`)
- **ChangeNotifier-based** DataProvider class using Provider package
- **Bridge layer** between UI and DatabaseService
- **Data management**: Handles expenses and categories throughout the app
- **Reactive updates**: Notifies UI of data changes via fetchData() method

#### UI Structure (`lib/screens/`)
- **`HomeScreen`** (`home_screen.dart`): Main application screen
  - Uses Provider.of<DataProvider> to access data
  - Displays expense list from the database
  - Material Design components
- **`main.dart`**: Application entry point with ChangeNotifierProvider setup

### Dependencies
- `sqflite_sqlcipher`: Encrypted SQLite database
- `provider`: State management
- `intl`: Internationalization support
- `cupertino_icons`: iOS-style icons

### Development Notes
- **Database reset**: Database is automatically deleted and recreated on app start (see `main.dart:14`) - useful for development
- **App theme**: Uses Teal as primary color theme with Material Design
- **Cross-platform**: Supports Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Development data**: Includes dummy expense data for testing (4 categories, 4 sample expenses)

## Working with This Project

### File Organization
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # Data models (Category, Expense)
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/         # UI screens (HomeScreen)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Business logic (DatabaseService, DataProvider)
â””â”€â”€ widgets/         # Reusable UI components (empty, ready for expansion)
```

### Key Implementation Details
- **Database initialization**: Handled in main() with proper async/await
- **Data flow**: UI â†’ DataProvider â†’ DatabaseService â†’ SQLite
- **Security**: All financial data is encrypted at rest using SQLite cipher
- **State management**: Provider pattern ensures UI reactivity to data changes
- **Development workflow**: Database reset on each run for consistent testing

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Security & Stability (High Priority)
- [ ] **Security Enhancement**: Replace hardcoded database password with secure key derivation or user input
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive try-catch blocks in database operations
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Implement proper error messages and user notifications
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Add input validation in models and UI forms
- [ ] **Testing**: Add unit tests for `DatabaseService` and `DataProvider`

### Phase 2: Core Features (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Enhanced Data Models**: Add fields like `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `currency`, `notes`
- [ ] **Expense Management**: Create expense form, editing, and deletion functionality
- [ ] **Category Management**: Add category creation, editing, and deletion
- [ ] **User Interface**: Add loading states, success/error messages, progress indicators
- [ ] **Environment Management**: Separate development/production configurations
- [ ] **Logging**: Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Filtering & Search**: Date range filters, category filters, search functionality
- [ ] **Reports & Analytics**: Basic spending trends, category breakdowns, monthly summaries
- [ ] **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export for expenses and reports
- [ ] **Data Import**: Import expenses from CSV or other formats
- [ ] **Backup & Restore**: Database backup and restore functionality
- [ ] **Multiple Users**: Support for multiple user profiles (optional)

### Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Overview screen with spending summaries and charts
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: Theme switching functionality
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Optimize for different screen sizes
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Add accessibility features and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Custom Exceptions**: Create specific exception classes (e.g., `DatabaseException`)
- [ ] **Constants**: Move magic strings and numbers to constants file
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Consider using get_it or similar for dependency management
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add comprehensive code documentation
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize database queries and UI rendering

### Example Implementation Pattern
```dart
// Enhanced error handling example
Future<List<Expense>> getExpenses() async {
  try {
    final db = await instance.database;
    final result = await db.rawQuery('''...');
    return result.map((json) => Expense.fromMap(json)).toList();
  } catch (e) {
    throw DatabaseException('Failed to fetch expenses: $e');
  }
}
```
